# AnimeImageScrapeNLearn

## Introduction
This repository embarks on a journey of understanding AI through the lens of anime art. It leverages a scraping method from [yunkai1841's Pixiv Scraper](https://github.com/yunkai1841/pixiv-scraper/tree/main) to collect AI-generated anime images from Pixiv for analysis and learning in developing an AI model.

## Project Components
- **Pixiv Scraper**: We use the method provided by yunkai1841's repository for collecting a diverse set of anime images.
- **Learning AI Model**: The project is centered around the ongoing learning and development of an AI model on Google Colab, which aims to effectively process and understand these images.

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Set up the Pixiv Scraper by following the guidelines in yunkai1841's repository to collect image data.
2. Progress with the AI model's development on Google Colab, training it with the scraped data.

Step-by-step instructions can be found in the respective component directories.
